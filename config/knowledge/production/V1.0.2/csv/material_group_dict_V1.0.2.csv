material_signifier,string,,"Signifier of the material, must be globally unique and uniform. It can be referenced in a CM's performance characteristics sheet.

Its naming is free, suggested are short abbreviations, acronyms or structural formulas (will not be compiled), written as one word, added a prefix (M for material, G for material group). The identifier might be visible in the application at several places. See the documentation for further information.

Important: Please note, that chemical elements do not need to be configured as they are supported implicitly. They can be used in a CM's performance characteristics sheet without being defined in the material sheet.","M-CARB-BLK for Carbon Black,
