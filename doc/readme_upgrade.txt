=======================================

- stop the application (simply hit ctrl-c in the shell of the running process
	or use stop_server.sh â€“ the latter only works if the WAR is called NanoDefiner.war)
- make a backup of the files in the installation directory
- copy the contents of the new ZIP archive into the installation directory
- make sure to follow version-specific upgrade instructions
- start the application using start_server.sh
